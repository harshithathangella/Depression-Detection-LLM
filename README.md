A project aimed at identifying and predicting depressive states using advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) and NLP techniques to aid mental health professionals with early intervention and accurate assessment.

Project Highlights:
1.Analyzes text to detect emotional distress and depressive patterns
2.Uses LLMs for contextual understanding and behavior-based insights
3.Applies sentiment analysis, tone detection, and language pattern recognition
4.Classifies severity levels: Minimal, Mild, Moderate, Severe

Technologies Used
Language Models: BERT, Transformers (HuggingFace)
Tech Stack: MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
Tools: Python, PyTorch, Google Colab
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn

This system enhances early detection, supports professionals, empowers users, and promotes mental wellness through data-driven, personalized insights.
